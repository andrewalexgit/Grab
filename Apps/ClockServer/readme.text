This is a very simple example of something that can be done with Grab. The server node is created and has enough functionality
to where a custom main method is built around it. The program waits for data to come in, and if a packet reads 'datetime@' the
server will prepare a date time string and serve it to the client. In this case to show how flexible this technology can be
the device running the client is an ESP8266 Feather HUZZAH board running Arduino and displays the time using an SSD1306 LCD
display. Together both the server and client create a crude but highly accurate internet clock.
